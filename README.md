# Hujing

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/albe-rosado/Hujing.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/albe-rosado/Hujing)
A very simple and easy to use GNOME application  for installing **flatpak** bundles without having to use the terminal. Made with love for those who aren't necessarily "good with computers" and just want something simple and reliable to install their apps.

 - `packagekit-glib2`
 
 Install it on Ubuntu based distributions doing:

(cd builddir && ninja)
